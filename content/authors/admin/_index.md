I am an beam scientist of high energy X-ray,  at [SPring-8](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/). My research and writing explore the in-situ XAFS, GISXAS/GIWAXS synchrotron measurement, phase transfer / reaction mechanism of electrode/electrolyte interface. I also have a strong interest in Electrocatalysts, high-entropy alloy catalysts.    

At SPring-8, I am a staff of BL14, data science and South Asia. I am on faculty in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/) and the [Elliott School of International Affairs](https://elliott.gwu.edu/) and am affiliated with the [Sigur Center for Asian Studies](https://sigur.elliott.gwu.edu/) as well as the Institute for [International Economic Policy](https://iiep.gwu.edu/).I also serve as one of the managing editors for the [Journal of Development Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/fjds20/current).
